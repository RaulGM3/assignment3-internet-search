        <h1>Christmas Vanila Wreath Cookies</h1>

        <p>A buttery Christmas cookie fit for small hands. Like all food blogs with a pinch of self-respect, requires a few pages long scrollable content of how much my family loves these cookies, how much these cookies will improve your overall lifestyle and even how well suited these buttery cookies are fit for small hand Santas. However, we will suffice with this paragraph and the next.</p>

        <p>Buttery cookies are great. Easy to make, easy to bake and easy to eat. Most importantly, remember to set out a plate of newly baked vanilla wreath cookies for Santa Claus. Please be aware, the butteriness from the cookies can stain old Santa Claus suits. We do supply fresh new Santa Claus suits for adults of a more delicate statue below 149 cm. Even small hand are in need of big plates of cookies. </p>
